# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

### Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Multiple Linear Regression model** to predict the demand for shared bikes in the US market after the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset includes various features that may impact bike rental demand, such as weather conditions, seasonal information, and daily trends. The main objective is to identify the key factors affecting bike demand and use these insights to help the company, **BoomBikes**, strategize and recover from the revenue losses caused by the pandemic.

### Problem Statement
BoomBikes, a bike-sharing service in the US, has experienced a significant drop in revenue due to the pandemic. They aim to understand the factors that influence bike rental demand to prepare for an anticipated surge in demand once lockdowns end. The business seeks insights on:
1. **Which variables significantly impact bike demand.**
2. **How these variables explain the fluctuations in demand.**

Using a comprehensive dataset, this project will help BoomBikes forecast future demand and develop an effective business strategy.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of daily records of bike rentals, along with various independent variables that describe weather conditions, holidays, weekdays, and other relevant factors. Key columns include:
- `cnt`: The target variable, representing the total bike rentals (sum of casual and registered users).
- `temp`, `atemp`: Temperature-related variables.
- `season`, `weathersit`: Categorical variables representing seasons and weather conditions.
- `yr`: Year of the data (2018 = 0, 2019 = 1).

The dataset requires careful preprocessing, including the conversion of categorical variables, handling multicollinearity, and feature scaling.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Convert numeric values of categorical variables (e.g., `season`, `weathersit`) into string categories.
   - Handle missing values (if any) and explore relationships between variables through visualizations and statistical summaries.
   - Perform one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Analyze and select the most significant variables based on correlations and domain knowledge.
   - Drop irrelevant features such as `casual` and `registered` users to avoid multicollinearity with the target variable `cnt`.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Build a Multiple Linear Regression model using `cnt` as the target variable.
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets, and train the model on the training set.
   - Evaluate the model on the test set using metrics like **R-squared** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Conduct residual analysis to validate the assumptions of linear regression (e.g., normality of residuals).
   - Calculate the **R-squared** score on the test set to measure the model's accuracy.

### Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: For data manipulation and model building.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data processing and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualizations for EDA.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training, evaluation, and validation.

### Results
- The model identifies the most significant features contributing to bike demand, including **temperature**, **season**, and **weather conditions**.
- The model’s performance is evaluated using **R-squared**, ensuring it provides a good fit to the test data.

### Subjective Questions
The answers to the subjective questions are provided in a separate PDF file, which includes:
- Insights on categorical variables, validation of assumptions, and a detailed explanation of the linear regression algorithm.
- Discussion on concepts like **Anscombe’s quartet**, **Pearson’s R**, and **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**.
